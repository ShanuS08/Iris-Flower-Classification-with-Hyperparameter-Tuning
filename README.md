# Iris-Flower-Classification-with-Hyperparameter-Tuning
This project involves classifying iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica using machine learning algorithms. By utilizing the Iris dataset, hyperparameter tuning was performed to optimize the models using Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Logistic Regression. The goal was to find the best model with the highest accuracy by tuning hyperparameters through GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV.

# Features:
- Data Loading: The Iris dataset from sklearn.datasets was used.
- Data Preprocessing: Data was split into training and test sets (80-20 ratio).
- Model Training:
Implemented classification using SVM, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression models.
Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV.
- Model Evaluation: Performed cross-validation to determine the best model and its optimal parameters.
  
# Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, scikit-learn
